## TETRIS

This game is played in the terminal and is meant to mimic the original Tetris game created in 1985 by Russian software engineer [Alexey Pajitnov](<https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alexey-Pajitnov>). After playing the board game [pentomino](<https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/smmg/archive/1997/radin.html>) in his office, Alexey Pajitnov decided to create a version of it virtually, which became the popular game of Tetris of the GameBoy.
